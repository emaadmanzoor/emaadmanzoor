# Hi!
<img src="https://www.cornell.edu/assets/core/images/logo-red@2x.png" height="100" align="right" style="padding: 2em;"/>

I am an Assistant Professor of
[Marketing](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/areas/marketing-and-management-communication/) and a graduate field member of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/directory?pos_title=Emaad&office=Emaad&keys=Emaad&department=All&location=All)
at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). You can reach me at *emaadmanzoor@cornell.edu*.

I design algorithms to improve human decisions. See [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=TcMyxM0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
for my papers and preprints ordered chronologically.

I created and teach [the generative AI course](/ai/) 
at Johnson. I have also taught a PhD seminar on human-algorithm
interactions ([syllabus](/teaching/NRE5220_F24_Syllabus.pdf)).
See [here](/teaching/) for my other teaching.

I am currently building [stoppingagents](https://stoppingagents.com/), [haggleforme.computer](https://haggleforme.computer), and [blprs](https://emaadmanzoor.com/blprs/). 
I have previously built [arborist](https://cmuarborist.github.io/), [xstream](https://cmuxstream.github.io), and [streamspot](https://sbustreamspot.github.io).

I co-organize the [Virtual Quant Marketing Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/vquantmarketing/virtual-quant-marketing-seminar) and serve on the editorial board of [Marketing Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/mksc/editorial-board).
