I am an assistant professor at the Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin - Madison

Methodologically, I develop scalable machine-learning methods that operate on data with complex structure, such as networks and text. Substantively, I use such methods to examine causal questions pertaining to persuasion and its linguistic determinants.
