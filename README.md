I am a fourth year PhD student in Information Systems at the [Heinz College](http://heinz.cmu.edu/) of [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dokyun Lee](https://www.leedokyun.com/) and [George Chen](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/). My research is supported by a [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) Ph.D. Fellowship.

Methodologically, I develop scalable machine-learning methods that operate on data with complex structure, such as networks and text. Substantively, I use such methods to examine causal questions pertaining to persuasion and its linguistic determinants.
