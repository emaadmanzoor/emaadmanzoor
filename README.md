I am a fourth year PhD student in Information Systems at the Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Dokyun Lee and George Chen. My research is supported by a McKinsey & Company Ph.D. Fellowship.

Methodologically, I develop scalable machine-learning methods that operate on data with complex structure, such as networks and text. Substantively, I use such methods to examine causal questions pertaining to persuasion and its linguistic determinants.
